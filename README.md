# Stock-Analysis

#Overview
The purpose of the stock analysis was to efficiently evaluate multiple stocks based on their return.
I refactored the code as instructed to run faster and added a new button linked to the refactored code.


#Results
As shown below, the refactored code ran faster than the code from class.
Based off of this, we can conclude that the refactored code is more efficient.
We are able to quickly analyze stocks and invest as soon as possible.



#Summary
The main advantage of refactoring code is increased efficiency.
With this, we can analyze more stocks, invest sooner, and be a well-informed investor.
The disadvantage to refactoring the code is that we did not save much time from the original code since it was already quick.
The potential to save time is an important benefit.
